# Complaint Chain Tracker for Public Issues

## 📌 Overview
The **Complaint Chain Tracker** is a web application designed to streamline the process of reporting, tracking, and resolving public complaints such as potholes, faulty streetlights, water issues, etc.  
It connects citizens with the relevant authorities and provides a transparent tracking system to monitor complaint progress until resolution.

- **Submit Complaints** – Citizens can raise complaints by providing a title, description, and category (e.g., Water, Electricity, Roads).
- **Complaint Assignment** – Complaints are automatically or manually assigned to the relevant authority department.
- **Status Tracking** – Authorities can update the complaint status (Pending, In Progress, Resolved).
- **Resolution Feedback** – Citizens can confirm resolution or provide feedback after completion.
- **Complaint History** – Users can view all their submitted complaints and statuses.
